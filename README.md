Hi!!!!

This is just a silly little project by me, because I like video games and random data. The program provides the number of plays and the average score for any game, provided the name. I'll be updating this a lot as I figure out how to work with Tkinter and urllib, and eventually, this should be a cool project. :)

The .zip file is just the VS Code file, so feel free to change/test whatever you want with it.
