Hi!!!!

This is just a silly little project by me, because I like video games and random data and the webbed site Backloggd

The program provides the number of "Plays" and the average score for any game, provided a link. Pointless, I know, but I thought it'd be fun.

This'll be updated more as I work on it to add more features and improve my Python skills. :)
